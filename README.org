* Dotfiles

Requirements:
- ~ansible~ to run the ~setup.yml~;
- ~python3-psutil~, which is needed by ansible to automatically configure the GNOME desktop environment using ~dconf~;
- you need to be running Fedora Workstation 37;
Clone this repository, ~cd~ into its directory and run the ~setup.yml~ playbook.
#+begin_src sh
  sudo ansible-playbook setup.yml
#+end_src
ansible will add some repositories (RPM Fusion and some ~copr~ repos), install all the packages I use, symlink the dotfiles, enable some services and configure GNOME.
